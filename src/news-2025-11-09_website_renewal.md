# Website Renewal

This is a small status update.

Since 2025-04-25, terranix has had two maintainers, [@sshine][sshine] and [@mdarocha][mdarocha].

[sshine]: https://github.com/sshine
[mdarocha]: https://github.com/mdarocha

While [@sshine][sshine] is new to terranix, he makes an effort to improve the documentation and testing.
