# Matrix Server Online

<div class="warning">
<b>2025-09-11:</b> The Matrix server doesn't accept registrations, making it hard to use.

This news item exists for historical reasons.

There [currently isn't an official terranix chatroom][chat-issue].

</div>

[chat-issue]: https://github.com/terranix/terranix.github.io/issues/16

Finally, I managed to create a matrix server to host the `#terranix:terranix.org` chat room.
Looking forward to talk to you! All you need is a matrix client and an account.

If you don't know where to start, just use element and create an account on `matrix.org`.
